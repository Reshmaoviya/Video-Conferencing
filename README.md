# Video-Conferencing
The purpose of the WMS is to automate the process of scheduling a meeting while considering time constraints of all the participants. The system will enable users to initiate and schedule meetings while viewing times that potential meeting attendees are available and busy. Through this automated process, meetings will be scheduled with a great deal more efficiency than the prior method of selecting and scheduling meeting times which required multiple communications between meeting initiator and participants before a time could be selected.
